# PI Motors controller server

WebSocket server responsible to control motors connected to the PI.

Mostly inspired from [this article](https://blog.logrocket.com/how-to-build-a-websocket-server-with-rust/) regarding the WebSocket server setup.

Here is a very short video showing the prototype in actions.
